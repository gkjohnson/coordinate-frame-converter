# coordinate-frame-converter

A Unity utility for simply converting between different coordinate frames.

## Dimensions
### Axis Direction

Which way is notionally considered "up", "left", and "forward"

### Rotation Order

Which order Euler angles are applied

### Rotation Direction

Whether positive rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise about the "right hand rule"

## TODO
- [ ] Add accessors for "L", "U", and "F" to retrieve the named axes in those directions. This might make rotation conversions easier.
- [ ] Add full coordinate frame conversions for euler angle rotations.
- [ ] Add tests for full coordinate frame rotations
