# coordinate-frame-converter

A Unity utility for simply converting between different coordinate frames.

## Considerations
### Axis Direction

Which way is notionally considered "up", "right", and "forward":

```
 U    
 |   F
 | Ôºè  
 .-----R
```

### Rotation Order

Which order Euler angles are applied.

### Rotation Direction

Whether positive rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise about the "right hand rule". Counterclockwise rotations are considered to be negative.

## Use
```cs

// Unity forward is _into_ the screen, and uses left handed rotations
CoordinateFrame UnityFrame = new CoordinateFrame("+X+Y-Z", "-Z-X-Y");
CoordinateFrame OtherFrame = new CoordinateFrame("XYZ", "XYZ");

// Convert a position from the other coordinate frame into Unity's
OtherFrame.ConvertPosition(UnityFrame, new Vector3(1, 3, 2));

// Convert a set of euler angles from Unity Frame into the other frame
// Angles are specified in 20 about Z, 30 about X, 40 about Y
UnityFrame.ConvertEulerAngles(OtherFrame, new EulerAngles(20, 30, 40));

// Wrapper for converting between frames
CoordinateFrameConverter Unity2Other = new CoordinateFrameConverter(UnityFrame, OtherFrame);
Unity2Other.ConvertPosition(new Vector3(1,2,3));

// Converting from the other frame to Unity's
Unity2Other.inverse.ConvertPosition(new Vector3(1,2,3));
```

## Classes
### Unity.Vector3
Represents the position in a coordinate frame. Specifys a point `x` units on the X axis, `y` units on the Y axis, and `z` units on the Z axis in the particular frame the point is in.

### EulerAngles
Represents the ordered rotation in a coordinate frame. Specifies the order in degrees a rotation should occur about the first, second, then third rotation axis as specified in a rotation order axis set.

### CoordinateFrame
A pair of AxisSets that specify both the position convention and rotation order.

#### CoordinateFrame(String axisConventions, String rotationOrder)
Construct a coordinate frame with the axis conventions and rotation order specified as strings.

#### ConvertPosition(CoordinateFrame other, Vector3 position)
Convert a position in the current coordinate frame into the other coordinate frame.

#### ConvertEulerAngles(CoordinateFrame other, EulerAngles angles)
Convert a set of euler angles from the current coordinate frame rotation order into the other coordinate frame.

### CoordinateFrameConverter
A helper class for converting back and forth between coordinate frames.

## Gotchas
- Unity takes euler orders as a vector and applies them in Z, X, Y order (taking them from place 2, then 0, then 1 from the vector). This library assumes the angles in EulerAngles are specified in the order they are applied, so Unity's would have to be specified as [Z, X, Y] in the struct. So Euler Angles specified as `Vector3(10, 20, 30)` in Unity would have to be specified as `EulerAngles(30, 10, 20)`

## TODO
- [ ] Get some real world test cases
- [ ] Pictures
- [ ] Reconsider naming of classes
- [ ] Add thrown errors for failing invalid axis orders
- [ ] Add flag to indicate whether or not an AxisSet has redundant rotation axes
- [ ] Look at options for reducing memory allocation and making AxisSets into structs
- [ ] Make the axis accessors in AxisSet more clear
